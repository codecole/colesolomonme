                    <h5>SUMMARY</h5>
                    <p>The fashion industry was first developed amongst Europeans & Americans, the industry was for a long time one of the largest employers in the United States and remains so in the 21st century. The raw materials particularly Fibre, textiles,
                        leather and fur which is in abundance in Africa, is required by the global fashion industry. The African fashion industry is receiving significant international repute and the feeling is that the continent’s fashion, design and
                        textile industry is here to stay.

                        <br><br>Africa Fashion Institute has stated that the potential ripple effect of the growth of Fashion on Africa’s economy cannot be overstated. Its growth is an invaluable and ongoing catalyst of job creation, small- to medium-business
                        development, and international interest and investment, among others. This is an international and highly globalized industry, with clothing often designed in one country, manufactured in another, and sold worldwide, and this plays
                        a huge economic significance in our present society. Despite obstacles, the digitisation of African fashion is inevitable via eCommerce.

                        <br><br>At Twizll, we want to decentralize the Fashion Industry in Africa for the global audience by digitizing the process of purchasing, selling and styling fashion. The aim is to enable African fashion enthusiast and lovers
                        to have a go to platform to buy, sell and style across the glob</p>

                    <h5>MY ROLE</h5>


                    <p>Asides executives, stakeholders and founding members, the team comprised of; a product designer, a product manager, two mobile engineers and a backend engineer.

                        <br><br> I worked as a product designer and I was tasked to redesign the fashion app consisting of the buyer app, seller app and a stylist app. I started the journey from the research; validation and competitive analysis, information
                        architecture, which progressed to a user flow. <br>The above translated into a wireframe, then conducted interviews testing the low-fidelity wireframes with the target audience, especially the seller application, before progressing
                        into Mid-High Fidelity stages. <br> I collaborated with the product manager and engineers by taking their input with respect to their fields, also I reached out to some external designers who are more experienced in the ecommerce
                        and design industry for design inputs.

                        <p></p>
                        <h5>CHALLENGES</h5>
                        <p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Logistics of products seamlessly especially in terms of returns</li>
                                <li>Getting verified sellers and stylists to match the international market for testing, feedback and iteration</li>
                                <li>Developing an African themed design that appeals to the global audience as well as Africans in diaspora and Africans within Africa</li>
                                <li>Avoid deviating from the previous brand direction and user flow, to avoid users experiencing difficulty adapting</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                        <h5> WHY DIVE INTO THIS?</h5>
                        <p>Imagine having the pleasure of shopping for fashion products, authentic quality african prints and materials, getting it delivered anywhere in the world or being able to showcase your store and showcase your style as a stylist
                            to create a trend and a trybe for your brand, all this from the comfort of your digital device. <br><br>Twizll is the only platform where you can buy, sell and style authentic made in Africa fashion products.</p>
                        <h5>PROCESS</h5>
                        <p>When designing Twizll which would be a long project, few questions needed to be answered which are: “How long will thenAfrican Fashion last?”,“How can this solution be scalable as it grows?” and “How do I sell Africa to the world”,
                            these were the stages I followed through</p>
                        <p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Validation</li>
                                <li>Competitive Analysis</li>
                                <li>Information Architecture</li>
                                <li>Wireframe</li>
                                <li>Low Fidelity testing</li>
                                <li>UI Design & Illustration</li>
                                <li>Interaction & High Fidelity Testing</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <div class="col-lg-12">
                            <figure><img src="../images/twizll-ui-detail01.png" alt="ecommerce_application_design_process"></figure>
                        </div>
                        <p>I established what the business goal is, conducting extensive research through the UX lens focusing more on empathizing with the existing users across buyers, sellers and stylist, figuring out the best way to design a service that
                            works for every stakeholder and use case. After synthesizing data from the surveys, interviews, and market research; I proceeded to define a solution hypothesis for each identified problem area.
                            <br><br>For this complex system with multiple stakeholders and users, I created an end-to-end information architecture and built a seamless workflow from one phase of the lifecycle to the next. I developed some high-level product
                            requirements and established several goals for this project.
                            <br>Then I proceeded by building a comprehensive components library that would later reflect in various parts of the app and still have the African theme, i.e., colors, typography, setting the grid, etc. This included icons,
                            buttons, form elements, error and empty states, show cards, and content cards.
                        </p>

                        <h6>ANALYSIS</h6>
                        <p> Figured some issues users were experiencing from the old application, and still had to figure how to increase retention and not entirely step out of the user flow and existing design of the solution. I decided to conduct a UX test
                            with some existing users for the buyer, seller and stylist app. This brought me to quite a number of issues.<br>

                            <div class="col-12">
                                <figure><img src="../images/twizll-analysis.png" alt="ecommerce_app_qualitative_analysis"></figure>
                            </div>

                            <br>These are some of the issues I outlined here after observing and testing each screen across the entire three use cases across the app:

                            <ol>
                                <br>
                                <li>On the landing page, where users decided which section of the app-type to navigate to, either buyer, seller or stylist, it lacked an onboarding feature, which would have helped in explaining and improving interaction coupled
                                    with the experience of what Twizll offers.</li>
                                <br>
                                <div class="col-12">

                                </div>
                                <li>Using engaging Twizll-themed-African illustrations that can be connecting with the users and elaborate each information for their respective screens.</li>
                                <li>Give users option to sign with social media to avoid lengthy forms, proper alignment and reduction on required forms to fill with improved design standards</li>
                                <br>
                                <div class="col-12">

                                </div>
                                <li> Use a native navigation within the app, to reduce the number of items to click and offer a native experience, since this isn't a web application. Use proper grouping of navigation items into respective categories and repositioning
                                    most clicked navigation items to be easier to access e,g cart.</li>
                                <br>
                                <div class="col-12">

                                </div>

                                <li>Product delivery and return should be covered by Twizll to avoid discrepancies or unresolved issues arising between Buyers and sellers
                                </li>
                                <br>

                    <h6>LANDING PAGE</h6>
                    <p>Time to test!!! I spoke to a few students and also some freelancers to test the prototype created in Adobe XD. I was able to get seven (7) persons to test, I had a mix of students - some have at some point used finance tool like cowryWise
                        and banking apps while others had never interacted with such tool. From the test session, I noted parts of the app users had issues interacting with and also got direct feedback on some features. One feature users had issues interacting
                        with was the task manager on the home screen which had a full calendar view of transactions, I noticed users were overwhelmed by this view so I decided to iterate on the design only showing a week view of and took off past events
                        from the view to keep it clean and ensure users focus and plan with current transactions. After all these changes were made, another test session was scheduled for just five users, feedback from these sessions were key to iterating
                        the interface design into the final solution.</p>
