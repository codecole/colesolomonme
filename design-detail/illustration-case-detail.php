                    <p>Divercity- Diversity & Inclusion solved; which is a recruitment platform, which focuses on solving diversity and iclusion for professionals and recruiters across every sector and organisation The need to improve interaction for users
                        was needed on empty states. I had to study all features of the app and create illustrations for each state that returns no content, for both web and mobile,

                    <div>
                        <h5>CHALLENGE</h5>
                        <p>Users are shown a blank screen or just a message to indicate empty states while using their solution and users are left confused, as to what is really happening, as most times they just go back or refresh the page, this was causing
                            a serious bounce rate and uninstallion of their app. To better improve interactio for users, empty states were needed</p>

                    <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
                    <p>The stakeholders sent me a brief containing the brand guide, about the company and also a list of competitors. I researched all the features that they share and took note of the empty states that are been used and most importantly
                        the call-to-action, users are to take at each state. This competitive analysis was further sent back to the Design team to review, this was to help me outline all the features that required empty states. I navigated carefully all
                        through the app with the UX reseacher and User researcher from the team , to capture all points that required empty states illustratio for both web and mobile.</p>
                        <p>Here is a snippet of the analysis and ongoing feedback for the notification empty states</p>

                    <h5>UNDERSTAND</h5>
                    <p>
                Bearing in mind insights from the research phase and the goal to make the empty states easy for users to adapt to and also what call-to-action were needed on each page, I jumped right into illustration and flow for each feature from the main touch point. I identified the major  elements and explored ways to represent them visually.

                    <p>
                I collaborated with the Ux researcher and User researcher, as to proper  and simple words that would help convey and not misinform users on what step to take next, when they land on an empty state.
                Also observe, for the case of their brand, the Humaaans library was used, as requested by the stakeholders, been that the brand was people focused

                <h6>TESTING</h6>
                    <p>The stake holders, and some selected recruiters and a few users were contacted to test the new states. Users navigated the app and keen attention was given to whether users would know what next decision to take when confronted with an empty state, or if what they wished was contained in terms on information, was the need of the users.
                        80% of the users that tested, had no issues with what next to do or understand what was wrong earlier, the recuiters although felt they were a lot of empty state illustrationa  and didnt seem it necessary.
                        Those empty state illustration were made synonymous to each other and another test session was conducted for existing users, feedback from
                        these sessions were key to iterating the interface design into the final solution
