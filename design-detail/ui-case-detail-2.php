                    <h5>CASE REVIEW</h5>
                    <p>The eTransact team wanted to build a new product providing solution to money management integrated as a new feature into their mobile banking application.
                    This product was going to be awesome, been that professionals, employers and students whom are active mobile phone users perform daily transactions on their phones digitally. 
                    Some of the features of this solution would be for the account inputs to be acquired through direct integration with the banking platform,
                    provision of all account transaction details for its customer.  </p>
                    <h5>CHALLENGE</h5>
                    <p>The assumption was that, there was a need for a platform that provides the user with their spending habits at a glance, and aid in better money management. 
                    The smartphone users running their daily transactions in Nigeria exceeds 146 million subscribers and over 90 million have access to internet services and data. The users cut across all sectors from the employees, students, employers and local business owners,  they all carry out expenses without having a proper balance of the inflow and outflow of funds,
                    thereby making it unrealistic to set and manage a budget. </p>
                    <h5>PROCESS</h5>
                    <p>

<ol><li>Discover - Usability review | Quantitative research | Research on similar apps</li>
<li>Understand - Document findings| Develop Personas </li>
<li> Ideate - Wireframe | High Fidelity </li>
<li>Review - User testing</li>
</ol>
</p>
                    <h5>Research</h5>
                    <p>The stakeholders sent a brief and I had to study it intensively to better understand the goal of the budget management  tool. This helped me to better understand the features associated with this tool and why those features existed.
Next, I interviewed people, which consisted of a student, a business man and an employed mother, who use banking applications and digital applications to run their daily transactions to know how they found such tools useful, what features they interact with frequently and what features they would like to see. I also explored other similar applications to understand how they work and to ascertain how best to visually represent features on the mobile app. This  helped me grasp the current experience, draft personas and provided direction for the user flow. </p>

                    <h5>MAIN FEATURES</h5>
                    <p>These are the main features of the app, with this app any user 
can create and track budgets, for any custom category.
 
Daily income and expenses are managed and kept on track, 
whether it be cash, transfer, cheque and bank transactions.

Users can set notification for different interactions with their 
money, such as exceeding budget for any category, inflow of 
money or when targets are met. 

Notifications are prompted via the app and statements can 
be sent via mails.</p>

                    <h5>UNDERSTANDING</h5>
                    <p>Bearing in mind insights from the research + understand phase and the goal to make features easy for users to discover, I jumped right into structuring the navigation and flow for each feature from the main touch point (the home page). I identified the major navigational elements and explored ways to represent them visually.</p>

                    <h6>TESTING</h6>
                    <p>Time to test!!! I spoke to a few students and also some freelancers to test the prototype created in Adobe XD. I was able to get seven (7) persons to test, I had a mix of students - some have at some point used finance tool like cowryWise and banking apps while others had never interacted with such tool. From the test session, I noted parts of the app users had issues interacting with and also got direct feedback on some features.
One feature users had issues interacting with was the task manager on the homescreen which had a full calendar view of transactions, I noticed users were overwhelmed by this view so I decided to iterate on the design only showing a week view of and took off past events from the view to keep it clean and ensure users focus  and plan with current transactions.
After all these changes were made, another test session was scheduled for just five users, feedback from these sessions were key to iterating the interface design into the final solution.</p>
